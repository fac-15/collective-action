Taken from Chuck Palahniuk’s iconic 1990s novel-turned-film *Fight Club*, the term **‘snowflake’** has come to be the go-to derogatory term for liberals and progressives.

We believe that climate change is an issue that’s worth getting offended over. *Snowflakes* aims to provide a starting point for young people looking to get involved with climate change activism for the first time.

This is a project by Oliver, Jihyun, Cynthia & Kristina from Founders & Coders 15.
